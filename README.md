# City of Cape Town - Data Science Unit Code Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate the skills of prospective Data Analysts for positions in the City of Cape Town. 

## Intended audience

We will only evaluate responses to this challenge from people who have been requested to complete it. Of course, you are welcome to attempt it for your own enjoyment.

## Way of working and expected structure of submission
Principles of reproducible analysis and code versioning are very important to our workflow. Structuring your work to aid in reproducibility and readability is important. 

So, follow common conventions with respect to directory structure and names to make your work as easy to follow as possible.

## What we're looking for
### Expectation of Effort
We expect you to spend up to 48 hours working on this assessment. If you are finding that you spending significantly more time than this, then please contact whomever sent you the link to this assessment to let them know.

You should have received over 7 days warning that you would be undertaking this assesment. Please notify [Delyno du Toit](delyno.dutoit@capetown.gov.za) if this was not the case.

### Things to focus on
Over and and above the tasks specified below, there are particular aspects of each position that we would like you to pay attention to:

* Data Analyst candidates - we consider success for our analysts when they provide the insights that inform actual decisions. Hence, we want evidence of both the ability to surface these insights from data, as well as the rhetorical skill in conveying the implications thereof. Your audience is intelligent, but non-specialist.

### Submission outline
You can use any tool to produce the output, e.g. Python, R, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, etc. The final deliverable needs to be a pdf report with your analysis.

## How to submit
1. Download this repository using the Code -> `Download ZIP` option in the top right-hand corner.
2. Add your work into this folder.
3. Create a compressed archive file with all of your work in it.
4. Send us an email, with your archived project attached. If it is larger than 10 MB, then share it via a cloud storage service such as DropBox, and include the link in your email. 

## Challenge
### 0. Setup
#### Data
We have made the following dataset available (the filename is a link). It is available in an AWS bucket `cct-ds-code-challenge-input-data`.
* [`assessment-data-analyst-sample-data.csv`](https://cct-budgets-code-challenge-input-data.s3.amazonaws.com/opm.assessment-data-analyst-sample-data.csv)

### 1. Descriptive Analytic Tasks (if applying for a Data Analyst Position)
Please use the `assessment-data-analyst-sample-data.csv` dataset to address the following.

The dataset contians the annual budget allocations, and annual virement movements, for various departments and branches of the organisation, broken down by budget `category` and `sub_category`. 

For the sake of this exercise, assume that the movement of funds after the allocation of the budget (`amount_sent`, `amount_received`) represents a budgeting allocation inefficiency.

Identify the top 5 budget sub-categories which have consistently had the lowest budget allocation efficiency over time, as well as the top 5 with the highest allocation efficiency.

Please provide the following:

An Executive-level report, non-specialist person should be able to read this report and follow your graphs and analysis narrative without guidance.

## Contact
You can contact gordon.inggs and/or colinscott.anthony @ capetown.gov.za for any questions on the above.
